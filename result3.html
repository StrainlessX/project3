                The revolutionary masterpiece of Archer was the first sports car of the company, 
                which also received a favorite welcome from users. The two-seater sedan had a 
                230-horsepower rear engine.

                The Galena was commissioned by the government. The government intended to 
                alleviate the negative feelings of the people during the economic collapse and 
                hoped to introduce a model that would be liked by the people of the lower class.
